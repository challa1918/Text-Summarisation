Input Text 
Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or a
bout 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Ce
lsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 y
ears, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.

The result
? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5 warmest years on
 record have all occurred since 2015. Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising g
lobal temperatures, but numerous studies, including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, have dis
proved this claim. The impacts of global warming are already harming people around the world.
